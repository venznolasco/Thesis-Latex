ABSTRACT = {Multi-Objective Multi-Camera Tracking (MOMCT) is aimed at locating and identifying multiple objects from video captured by multiple cameras. With the advancement of technology in recent years, it has received a lot of attention from researchers in applications such as intelligent transportation, public safety and self-driving driving technology. As a result, a large number of excellent research results have emerged in the field of MOMCT. To facilitate the rapid development of intelligent transportation, researchers need to keep abreast of the latest research and current challenges in related field. Therefore, this paper provide a comprehensive review of multi-object multi-camera tracking based on deep learning for intelligent transportation. Specifically, we first introduce the main object detectors for MOMCT in detail. Secondly, we give an in-depth analysis of deep learning based MOMCT and evaluate advanced methods through visualisation. Thirdly, we summarize the popular benchmark data sets and metrics to provide quantitative and comprehensive comparisons. Finally, we point out the challenges faced by MOMCT in intelligent transportation and present practical suggestions for the future direction.},
