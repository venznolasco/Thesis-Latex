  abstract  = "Retailers need accurate movement pattern analysis of
               human-tracking data to maximize the space performance of their
               stores and to improve the sustainability of their business.
               However, researchers struggle to precisely measure customers'
               movement patterns and their relationships with sales. In this
               research, we adopt indoor positioning technology, including
               wireless sensor devices and fingerprinting techniques, to track
               customers' movement patterns in a fashion retail store over four
               months. Specifically, we conducted three field experiments in
               three different timeframes. In each experiment, we rearranged
               one element of the visual merchandising display (VMD) to track
               and compare customer movement patterns before and after the
               rearrangement. For the analysis, we connected customers'
               discrete location data to identify meaningful patterns in
               customers' movements. We also used customers' location and time
               information to match identified movement pattern data with sales
               data. After classifying individuals' movements by time and
               sequences, we found that stay time in a particular zone had a
               greater impact on sales than the total stay time in the store.
               These results challenge previous findings in the literature that
               suggest that the longer customers stayed in a store, the more
               they purchase. Further, the results confirmed that effective
               store rearrangement could change not only customer movement
               patterns but also overall sales of store zones. This research
               can be a foundation for various practical applications of
               tracking data technologies.",
