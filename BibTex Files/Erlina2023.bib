  abstract  = "In Indonesia, assistance for small enterprises has grown in
               recent years. However, a monitoring system is required to
               support these enterprises and ensure their expansion and
               survival. Using a single-board computer and the YOLO algorithm,
               we construct a visitor tracking system in this study to meet
               this demand. To capture objects and categorize them as human or
               non-human, we employ the YOLOv4-tiny model, which has a mAP of
               89.21\%. Human visitors are welcomed with the use of a speaker.
               A telegraph bot that notifies the owner of the retail
               establishment of the visitor's presence also makes the
               presumption as to whether the visitor is a potential customer or
               an intruder. Our research demonstrates that the created
               monitoring system effectively recognizes and categorizes visits,
               enabling retail store owners to make defensible choices
               regarding visitor interaction and security precautions. Small
               business owners can save personnel costs while still maintaining
               high levels of client engagement and security. The theoretical
               application of this research is the creation of a visitor
               monitoring system that is affordable and may be used in small
               enterprises, particularly in Indonesia. The practical
               ramifications of our research include the possibility for small
               retail business owners to boost profits by lowering labor
               expenses while raising customer satisfaction and security. The
               importance of our study lies in its role in creating a
               monitoring system that will support small enterprises and
               increase their sustainability.",
