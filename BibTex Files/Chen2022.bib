  abstract  = "In order to improve the tracking failure caused by small-target
               pedestrians and partially blocked pedestrians in dense crowds in
               complex environments, a pedestrian target detection and tracking
               method for an intelligent vehicle was proposed based on deep
               learning. On the basis of the YOLO detection model, the channel
               attention module and spatial attention module were introduced
               and were joined to the back of the backbone network Darknet-53
               in order to achieve weight amplification of important feature
               information in channel and space dimensions and improve the
               representation ability of the model for important feature
               information. Based on the improved YOLO network, the flow of the
               DeepSort pedestrian tracking method was designed and the Kalman
               filter algorithm was used to estimate the pedestrian motion
               state. The Mahalanobis distance and apparent feature were used
               to calculate the similarity between the detection frame and the
               predicted pedestrian trajectory; the Hungarian algorithm was
               used to achieve the optimal matching of pedestrian targets.
               Finally, the improved YOLO pedestrian detection model and the
               DeepSort pedestrian tracking method were verified in the same
               experimental environment. The verification results showed that
               the improved model can improve the detection accuracy of
               small-target pedestrians, effectively deal with the problem of
               target occlusion, reduce the rate of missed detection and false
               detection of pedestrian targets, and improve the tracking
               failure caused by occlusion.",
