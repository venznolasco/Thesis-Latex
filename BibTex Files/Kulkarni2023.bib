  abstract  = "In this paper we provided a perspective on the integration of
               Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision in the retail
               sector, highlighting their transformative potential in reshaping
               industry dynamics. It delves into the multifaceted applications
               of AI in retail, including inventory management, personalized
               shopping experiences, dynamic outreach, and conversational
               support, underscoring how these technologies drive customer
               engagement, operational efficiency, and innovation in product
               and service offerings. Moreover, the study explores the role of
               Computer Vision in revolutionizing retail experiences through
               self-checkout systems, inventory management, store layout
               optimization, and AI-based loss prevention. Emphasizing the
               necessity of adopting these technologies, the paper contends
               that AI and Computer Vision are not mere competitive advantages
               but crucial for maintaining relevance in the swiftly evolving
               retail landscape. The strategic integration of these
               technologies presents significant opportunities for growth and
               differentiation, although it necessitates substantial investment
               in resources and workforce upskilling",
