  abstract  = "Abstract In order to reduce the influence of occlusion on the
               overall feature representation of tracks and improve the
               accuracy of track correlation between cameras, this paper
               proposes a cross camera multi-target tracking method based on
               person appearance and spatial-temporal constraints: a new
               cross-camera multi-object tracking framework is constructed.
               Then the person spatial-temporal probability model is
               established. Finally, the spatial-temporal probability model and
               the person appearance similarity are jointly measured and the
               person trajectory correlation under cross-camera is completed by
               using data correlation; Comparative experiments on the dataset
               proved that the method is effective.",
